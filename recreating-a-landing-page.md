# Recreating a Landing Page

To practice CSS I decided to recreate this page: [React Training](https://reacttraining.com/courses//images/blue-fade.svg).

It is a rather simple page but it is also elegant and responsive in a way that I would like to practice
and study on a deeper level.

I imagine these React guys know what they are doing.

It contains some common parts of a web page:
+ a hamburger menu
+ header area with logo icon, text logo and subheading
+ Call to Action button
+ Tagline
+ Footer
+ Extra footer with copywrite info

It is organized in blocks or cards which is good for responsiveness, since they can be moved around
without messing up the page.

So, let's get started. Mobile first, so I shrink it in a separate window of Chrome and then work from Codepen
in another window. I will first create the page without looking at the source code, since that feels like cheating.
