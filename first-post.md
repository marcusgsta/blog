# 2019-11-27 First Post

So, I decided to start a blog where I share things I learn about web design - and development.
Since I haven't yet decided on how I would publish the blog, I created a Git Repo and a markdown-file.

I thought of alternatives, either building a blog with React.js and Firebase, or making a Wordpress site. Both of these would 
let me practice. But at the same time, I feel a bit lazy about setting up a new big project, when I just want to get started 
with producting content as fast as possible.

Having said that, I might move the content to another place at a later point.

Turns out Github even has their own Github flavored Markdown, with which you can get syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
